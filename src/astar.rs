/// The shortest path starting from `start` up to a node for which `success` returns `true` is
/// computed and returned along with its total cost, in a `Some`. If no path can be found, `None`
/// is returned instead.
///
/// - `start` is the starting node.
/// - `neighbours` returns a list of neighbours for a given node, along with the cost for moving
/// from the node to the neighbour.
/// - `heuristic` returns an approximation of the cost from a given node to the goal. The
/// approximation must not be greater than the real cost, or a wrong shortest path may be returned.
/// - `success` checks whether the goal has been reached. It is not a node as some problems require
/// a dynamic solution instead of a fixed node.
///
/// A node will never be included twice in the path as determined by the `Eq` relationship.
///
/// The returned path comprises both the start and end node.
