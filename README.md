This crate implements several pathfinding, flow, and graph algorithms in [Rust][Rust].

## Algorithms

The algorithms are generic over their arguments.

### Directed graphs

- [A*][A*]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [BFS][BFS]: explore nearest successors first, then widen the search.
- [DFS][DFS]: explore a graph by going as far as possible, then backtrack.
- [Dijkstra][Dijkstra]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- [Edmonds Karp][Edmonds Karp]: find the maximum flow in a weighted graph.
- [Fringe][Fringe]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [IDA*][IDA*]: explore longer and longer paths in a weighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
- [IDDFS][IDDFS]: explore longer and longer paths in an unweighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
- [strongly connected components][Strongly connected components]: find strongly connected components in a directed graph.
- [topological sorting][Topological sorting]: find an acceptable topological order in a directed graph.
- [Yen][Yen]: find k-shortest paths using Dijkstra.

### Undirected graphs

- [connected components][Connected components]: find disjoint connected sets of vertices.
- [Kruskal][Kruskal]: find a minimum-spanning-tree.

### Matching

- [Kuhn-Munkres][Kuhn-Munkres] (Hungarian algorithm): find the maximum (or minimum) matching
in a weighted bipartite graph.

### Miscellaneous structures

- A `Grid` type representing a rectangular grid in which vertices can be added or removed,
  with automatic creation of edges between adjacent vertices.
- A `Matrix` type to store data of arbitrary types, with neighbour-aware methods.

## Using this crate

In your `Cargo.toml`, put:

``` ini
[dependencies]
pathfinding = "3.0.10"
```

You can then pull your preferred algorithm (BFS in this example) using:

``` rust
extern crate pathfinding;

use pathfinding::prelude::bfs;
```

## Example

We will search the shortest path on a chess board to go from (1, 1) to (4, 6) doing only knight
moves.

``` rust
use pathfinding::prelude::bfs;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, Hash, Ord, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Pos(i32, i32);

impl Pos {
  fn successors(&self) -> Vec<Pos> {
    let &Pos(x, y) = self;
    vec![Pos(x+1,y+2), Pos(x+1,y-2), Pos(x-1,y+2), Pos(x-1,y-2),
         Pos(x+2,y+1), Pos(x+2,y-1), Pos(x-2,y+1), Pos(x-2,y-1)]
  }
}

static GOAL: Pos = Pos(4, 6);
let result = bfs(&Pos(1, 1), |p| p.successors(), |p| *p == GOAL);
assert_eq!(result.expect("no path found").len(), 5);
```

## Note

Several algorithms require that the numerical types used to describe
edges weights implement `Ord`. If you wish to use Rust builtin
floating-point types (such as `f32`) which implement `PartialOrd`
in this context, you can wrap them into compliant types using the
[ordered-float](https://crates.io/crates/ordered-float) crate.

The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is Rust 1.60.0.

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute by opening [issues](https://github.com/samueltardieu/pathfinding/issues)
or submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/samueltardieu/pathfinding/pulls). Please open an issue
before implementing a new feature, in case it is a work in progress already or it is fit for this
repository.

In order to pass the continuous integration tests, your code must be formatted using the latest
`rustfmt` with the nightly rust toolchain (available as the `rustfmt-preview` component of `rustup`).

This repository use the imperative mode in commit messages, such as "Add IDDFS",
"Fix #xxx". This style is preferred over "Added IDDFS" or "Fixed #xxx".
